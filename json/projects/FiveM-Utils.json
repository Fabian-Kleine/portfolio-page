This can be useful for the vMenu spawnlist etc..",

These can than simply be copied over from the output textfiles to the files where they belong."

Some folders that are not important are ignored by default.<br />The getVehicles.py file is a bit more complicated. It has to read the XML files where the vehicles are specified. In the XML files it reads the key value <i>modelName</i> which we need to later spawn the vehicle in Game. As in ensure.py we need to loop through the directorys."
